# CryptosporidiumSlippage
A repository for the analyses of PCR slippage in _Cryptosporidium_ spp. gp60 amplicons

## Overview

A repository for `R` and `bash` scripts to accompany our manuscript on our observations on PCR slippage in _Cryptosporidium_ spp. gp60 amplicons using the `dada2` [tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) as a basis, but with changes to key parameters.  Such changes are described below.

**Title**: "Quantifying replication slippage error in _Cryptosporidium_ metabarcoding studies"

**Authors**: Matt A Knox, Patrick J Biggs, Juan-Carlos Garcia-R and David T S Hayman.

This repository contains the following files and scripts:
* `R script part 1`
* `bash work`
* `R script part 2`
